                <h2>Delstun McCray.</h2>
                <p>I approach iOS app development from the perspective of both the programmer and the user. Through my skills with Swift and Objective-C, I create apps that are not only serviceable and reliable but also enjoyable and easy to use. After extensive training and experience in this field, I’ve become proficient in multiple iOS developmental programs, including MVC, Cloudkit, UIKit, and more.</p>

                    <p>Like many kids growing up in the 2010s, I always had a phone in my hand. But as I got older, my interest shifted from just using apps to understanding how they worked behind the scenes. In 2020, I took the leap into iOS development, and it's been one of the most rewarding decisions I’ve ever made.<br><br>
Beyond iOS development, I'm expanding my horizons by pursuing a career in cybersecurity at Davis Tech. This journey not only complements my development skills but also equips me to understand the broader security challenges that modern applications face.<br><br>
In addition to my technical skills, I pride myself on tackling challenges with an open mind. Whether working independently or collaborating with others, I approach every project with a problem-solving mindset. As both the fields of iOS development and cybersecurity continue to evolve, I’m excited to grow along with them, becoming a more versatile and knowledgeable developer.</p>
